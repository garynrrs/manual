GIT MANUAL
As I learn to use git I will note the most important commands here, with my own comments where necessary.

git init		make a folder a repository
git init [repository]	create a folder as a repository
git clone URL		clone a repository and create a local folder of that name
			also does a git remote add origin https://url/repository.git in the background

git status

git branch			list branches
git branch dev			create dev branch
git branch -D dev		delete permanently dev branch

git checkout [branchname]	start working in the branch
git checkout -b dev		create branch dev and check it out

git diff	show difference between files

git add [file name]	add file to staging area
git add .		add all unstaged files to staging area
git add -A		add all unstaged files to staging area

git commit
git commit-m "[commit message]"

git pull		combines git fetch and git merge
git push

git remote add origin https://url/repository.git	adds remote repository called origin
git remote						show remote branches
git push -u origin master	first time only use -u, push and merge master with remote origin, allows tracking of remote repository, visible in git status etc

git push --set-upstream https://github.com/garynrrs/manual master

git fetch		pulls down remote repository branches and makes local branches with them

git pull origin master		pull remote origin and merge into local master branch
